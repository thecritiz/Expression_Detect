# Emotion Detection with OpenCV and Keras

This project is an emotion detection system that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify emotions based on facial expressions. It employs OpenCV for face detection using Haar cascades and a Keras-based neural network for emotion recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time facial emotion recognition** using a webcam.
- **Haar cascades** for face detection.
- **Deep learning model** (Keras) for emotion classification.
- The model is trained to recognize seven emotions: `angry`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `neutral`, `sad`, and `surprise`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
